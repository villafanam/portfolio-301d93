      "description": "I'm Marco Villafana. After serving in the military as an information technology specialist, I decided I wanted to pursue a career in computer science. I am currently graduated from Central Washington University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am currently enrolled in Code Fellows code training program for full stack software development in JavaScript. My experience in the military has left me with a multitude of skills to draw from. I retired as sergeant (supervisor position). I had the opportunity to develop skills such as problem solving, self-discipline, attention to detail and critical thinking. Furthermore, I have practical experience working in a team where I developed leadership skills. While I was stationed in South Korea, I was part of the networking team, in which were responsible for over 300 computer systems and local area networks. I was the technician, who would go on site and work with the clients to complete trouble tickets. Therefore, I think I would be a substantial asset to your team.",
